# Data Analysis with R
This repository will host all materials related to the course on data analysis with R

## Introduction

Welcome to the online wiki of the Data Analysis with R course! This course is hosted in the context of the World Bank (WB) basic econometrics, nowcasting, and macro-structural trainings provided under the EU-financed Strengthening Fiscal Governance in Western Balkans Trust Fund.

This repository will serve as your central hub for all course materials and resources necessary for the program and beyond, and will remain online and open for your use. Copies of the materials can also be found on my GitHub page.

In this course, we'll dive into the fundamentals of R programming, focusing on its practical applications in economic analysis from basic data manipulation to advanced visualization techniques. The goal of the course is to equip you with the tools and knowledge to become a proficient R user, capable of conducting complex data transformation and analysis with ease.

The course is instructed by Gentian Gashi, a consultant for data and economics at the World Bank. Should you have questions, need clarification, or want to share your insights, feel free to reach out at *ggashi\@worldbank.org*.
